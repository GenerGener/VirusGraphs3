# VirusGraphs3
Solidifying the VirusGraphs Infrastructure for Deployment

## Linear reference genomes aren't great..

![](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/VirusGraphs3/blob/master/limit_of_linear.png)
Linear references are the gold standard for genomics applications, including capturing viral genome information and viral sequence recovery. Examples include HIV sequence detection and HIV genome assembly. HIV genome assembly can be loosely classified into whole (reference) genome assebly and HIV genotyping (partial assembly).

## Implementation

### Reference graphs

For approximate k-mer graphs: [original SWIGG](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/SWIGG), [implemented SWIGG](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/Virus_Graphs).
For nucleobase graphs: [NovoGene](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/NovoGraph)
[VG](https://github.com/vgteam/vg).

#### Extension of SWIGG
In the original graph created by SWIGG without any filtering parameters, the number of nodes are usually so large that it would result in inefficient visualization and other downstream analysis. Therefore, we implemented the algorithm to make a compact de Bruijn graph. Contraction of nodes starts by a depth-first-search from the source node of the graph. Nodes are included into a supernode continuously as the algorithm walks through the graph. A new supernode is created when the algorithm encounters a node with more than 1 neighbor. The size of the contracted graph is significantly reduced after contraction algorithm is applied (Table ?).

### Transcript modeling
For split-read mapping, [HISAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml) was used, and output .bam was pipped into
[StringTie](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/), both in [Galaxy](usegalaxy.eu).

## Results 

### for SWIGG

Graphs built with different k-mer lengths:
![SWIGG built for HIV2 (6 seqs)](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/VirusGraphs3/blob/master/swigg_figure/HIV2_graph_merged.png)

The above figure contains 5 graphs built with different k-mer lengths. (a) k=16, (b) k=20, (c) k=32, (d) k=50, (e) k=90. Longer k-mers cover more repetitive regions. Therefore, longer k-mers result in simpler graphs. Red rectangles highlights the large loop topology in graphs made by small k-mers. The loops are the results of the repeititive k-mers in regions far apart.
